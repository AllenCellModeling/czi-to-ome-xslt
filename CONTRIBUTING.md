Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

## Get Started!
Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `czi-to-ome-xslt` for local development.

1. Fork the `czi-to-ome-xslt` repo on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork locally:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:{your_name_here}/czi-to-ome-xslt.git
    ```

3. Install `lxml`:

    ```bash
    cd czi-to-ome-xslt/
    pip install lxml
    ```

4. Create a branch for local development:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b {your_development_type}/short-description
    ```

    Ex: feature/read-tiff-files or bugfix/handle-file-not-found<br>
    Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass linting and
   tests, including testing other Python versions with make:

    ```bash
    python transform.py
    ```

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Resolves gh-###. Your detailed description of your changes."
    git push origin {your_development_type}/short-description
    ```

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
